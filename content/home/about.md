# About

I am a social psychologist and Postdoctoral Research Associate with [Buju Dasgupta in the Implicit Social Cognition labratory](https://people.umass.edu/nd/) at UMass Amherst.

My research focuses on the role of cross-group friendships and relationships (i.e., intergroup contact) as well as influences of the broader social environment (e.g., diversity or segregation)
in shaping social cognition. I investigate these topics using advanced quantitative methods and am especially interested in Bayesian methods.
