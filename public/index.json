We studied a cohort of gender nonconforming children (N=85).  When re-contacted approximately 2 years later, 36 of the children had socially-transitioned. We found that stronger cross-sex identification and preferences expressed by gender nonconforming children at initial testing predicted whether they later socially-transitioned. We then compared the gender nonconforming children to groups of transitioned transgender children (N=84) and gender conforming controls (N=85).  Children from our longitudinal cohort who would later transition were highly similar to transgender children and control children of the gender to which they would eventually transition, while gender nonconforming children who would not go on to transition were different from these groups.  These results suggest that (a) social transitions may be predictable from gender identification and preferences and (b) gender identification and preferences may not meaningfully differ before and after social transitions.","tags":["Developmental Psychology","Multilevel Modeling","Bayesian Data Analysis","Multiverse Analysis"],"title":"Predicting Early Childhood Gender Transitions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James R.

This is a post written with Nils Karl Reimer.\nThis post provides a gentle introduction to fitting Bayesian logistic regression models using the brms package in R (Bürkner, 2017). Why use brms? Besides being an excellent package with lots of cool features, the specification of regression models in brms closely mirrors the syntax you may already use to fit regression models in R, such as with the lm() or glm() commands. This should make a first pass at fitting Bayesian logistic regression models easier.\nBefore jumping into the tutorial, a couple of caveats: We’re assuming that you have some familiarity with (1) the R statistical computing environment, (2) interpreting logistic regression models, and (3) key concepts in Bayesian statistical analyses. If you need a refresher on R, see here. For information on logistic regression, perhaps take a look at this introductory tutorial. If you’d like some background on Bayesian methods and are short on time, We’d suggest this article. For a more thorough coverage, see McElreath (2017), Lambert (2018), or—if you’re ready for the deep dive—Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman and colleagues (2016).\nOK, let’s dive in!\nThe Data\rWe’re going to use some data collected via Project Implicit—a non-profit organization that operates a virtual laboratory where people can take various versions of the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Project Implicit kindly makes the data from this site publicly available on the Open Science Framework. Anyone can use it (just acknowledge Project Implicit in any publications!) and there’s a lot of it. You should check it out!\nThis tutorial uses data from the Sexuality IAT collected during 2017. If you’re not familiar with this particular version of the IAT, it measures someone’s relative preference for straight people over gay people. Scores above zero indicate a preference for straight people over gay people, a score of zero indicates no preference for either group, and scores below zero indicate a preference for gay people over straight people. Specifically, we’re going to look at whether implicit straight/gay attitudes predicts attitude-relevant policy positions.\nThe raw data for the Sexuality IAT task is available here. However, Bayesian analyses can be quite computationally intensive. As there is data from over 300,000 respondents in the 2017 data set, we’ll be working with a random draw of 5,000 sessions so it’s less time intensive for you to try these analyses for yourself. We’ve also done some data cleaning and recoding. If you want to see how we derived the data for this example, see here.\n\rGetting Ready for the Analyses\rFirst, we’re going to have a couple of packages handy to get started:\nlibrary(brms); library(tidyverse); library(tidybayes); library(ggplot2); library(LaplacesDemon)\r## Warning: package \u0026#39;LaplacesDemon\u0026#39; was built under R version 3.5.2\rAs you already know, we’re going to need the brms package to fit our logistic regression models. Critically, brms relies on Stan (Stan Development Team, 2017), which is a great tool for fitting Bayesian analyses. For details on installing Stan, see here. Once you’ve done these steps you’ll need to have the brms library loaded. Another option is to use the free RStudio cloud service—they already have Stan installed. For details, see here.\nNow, let’s read the data into R:\nlrsmall \u0026lt;- read_csv(url(\u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesrrae/sexuality-iat-website-data/master/lrsmall.csv\u0026quot;))\rNow, let’s get a sense of the data:\nprint(lrsmall)\r## # A tibble: 5,000 x 2\r## Allowed D.z\r## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 NA 1.48 ## 2 1 0.976\r## 3 NA NA ## 4 1 0.568\r## 5 NA NA ## 6 1 1.08 ## 7 1 -1.68 ## 8 1 -0.507\r## 9 1 0.487\r## 10 NA 0.174\r## # ... with 4,990 more rows\rOk, so we have two variables that we’ll use for our logistic regression analysis. Allowed indexes self-reported answers to the question “Do you think it should be legal for same-sex partners to adopt a child?”. We’ll just focus on two response options: 0 = “Should not be legal” and 1 = “Should be legal”. The variable D.z is standardized IAT scores calculated by subtracting off the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.\nNext, let’s look at the correlation between our two variables. This will help us know what to expect before doing our logistic regression analysis:\ncor.test(lrsmall$Allowed,lrsmall$D.z)\r## ## Pearson\u0026#39;s product-moment correlation\r## ## data: lrsmall$Allowed and lrsmall$D.z\r## t = -13.083, df = 2922, p-value \u0026lt; 2.2e-16\r## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\r## 95 percent confidence interval:\r## -0.2691916 -0.2007010\r## sample estimates:\r## cor ## -0.2352383\rThe variables are negatively correlated at about .20. And this makes sense—people with stronger implicit preferences for straight people over gay people are less likely to report that it’s OK for same-sex couples to adopt.\n\rUsing brms for Logistic Regression Analysis\rFirst, we must set some priors for the parameters in our logistic regression model—the intercept and slope. We follow common prior choice recommendations for the intercept and slope:\n\\[ \\beta \\sim \\text{Student}(3, 0, 2.5) \\]\nThis prior is a Student-t distribution (bell-shaped but with fatter tails than a normal distribution) with 3 degrees of freedom, a mean of 0, and scale of 2.5. This is a pretty wide prior. To see why, let’s look at the distribution:\nx_values \u0026lt;- seq(-15,15, length.out = 1000)\rdata.frame(x_values) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x_values))+\rstat_function(fun=dst, args=list(nu=3,mu=0,sigma=2.5))\rAs you can see from the figure, this prior roughly expresses an expectation most values to be between -10 and +10. However, as pointed out by Gelman and colleagues (2008), even a change from -5 to 0 correspondents to a change on a probability scale of .01 to .50. It would be pretty huge effect if a 1 unit change in D.z (i.e., a 1 standard deviation difference on the IAT) corresponded to nearly .50 change in the probability of supporting adoption rights for same-sex couples. For further discussion of these priors, see Gelman et al. 2008.\nNow, let’s specify these priors in a format that brms can use when we run the model:\nm1priors \u0026lt;- c(\rprior(student_t(3, 0, 2.5), class = \u0026quot;Intercept\u0026quot;),\rprior(student_t(3, 0, 2.5), class = \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;)\r)\rOk, now we’re finally ready to fit our model (be warned, this could take a bit of time!):\nm1 \u0026lt;- brm(\rAllowed ~ D.z,\rdata = lrsmall,\rprior = m1priors,\rfamily = \u0026quot;bernoulli\u0026quot;,\rseed = 123 # Adding a seed makes results reproducible.\r) \r## Warning: Rows containing NAs were excluded from the model.\r## Compiling the C++ model\r## Start sampling\r## ## SAMPLING FOR MODEL \u0026#39;d59bd52f6c6c61f33001490da41f7746\u0026#39; NOW (CHAIN 1).\r## Chain 1: Gradient evaluation took 0 seconds\r## Chain 1: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 0 seconds.\r## Chain 1: Iteration: 1 / 2000 [ 0%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 1: Iteration: 200 / 2000 [ 10%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 1: Iteration: 400 / 2000 [ 20%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 1: Iteration: 600 / 2000 [ 30%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 1: Iteration: 800 / 2000 [ 40%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 1: Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 1: Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 1: Iteration: 1200 / 2000 [ 60%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 1: Iteration: 1400 / 2000 [ 70%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 1: Iteration: 1600 / 2000 [ 80%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 1: Iteration: 1800 / 2000 [ 90%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 1: Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 1: Elapsed Time: 1.872 seconds (Warm-up)\r## Chain 1: 1.638 seconds (Sampling)\r## Chain 1: 3.51 seconds (Total)\r## ## SAMPLING FOR MODEL \u0026#39;d59bd52f6c6c61f33001490da41f7746\u0026#39; NOW (CHAIN 2).\r## Chain 2: Gradient evaluation took 0 seconds\r## Chain 2: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 0 seconds.\r## Chain 2: Iteration: 1 / 2000 [ 0%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 2: Iteration: 200 / 2000 [ 10%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 2: Iteration: 400 / 2000 [ 20%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 2: Iteration: 600 / 2000 [ 30%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 2: Iteration: 800 / 2000 [ 40%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 2: Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 2: Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 2: Iteration: 1200 / 2000 [ 60%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 2: Iteration: 1400 / 2000 [ 70%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 2: Iteration: 1600 / 2000 [ 80%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 2: Iteration: 1800 / 2000 [ 90%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 2: Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 2: Elapsed Time: 1.859 seconds (Warm-up)\r## Chain 2: 1.901 seconds (Sampling)\r## Chain 2: 3.76 seconds (Total)\r## ## SAMPLING FOR MODEL \u0026#39;d59bd52f6c6c61f33001490da41f7746\u0026#39; NOW (CHAIN 3).\r## Chain 3: Gradient evaluation took 0.001 seconds\r## Chain 3: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 10 seconds.\r## Chain 3: Iteration: 1 / 2000 [ 0%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 3: Iteration: 200 / 2000 [ 10%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 3: Iteration: 400 / 2000 [ 20%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 3: Iteration: 600 / 2000 [ 30%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 3: Iteration: 800 / 2000 [ 40%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 3: Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 3: Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 3: Iteration: 1200 / 2000 [ 60%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 3: Iteration: 1400 / 2000 [ 70%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 3: Iteration: 1600 / 2000 [ 80%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 3: Iteration: 1800 / 2000 [ 90%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 3: Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 3: Elapsed Time: 1.909 seconds (Warm-up)\r## Chain 3: 1.804 seconds (Sampling)\r## Chain 3: 3.713 seconds (Total)\r## ## SAMPLING FOR MODEL \u0026#39;d59bd52f6c6c61f33001490da41f7746\u0026#39; NOW (CHAIN 4).\r## Chain 4: Gradient evaluation took 0.001 seconds\r## Chain 4: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 10 seconds.\r## Chain 4: Iteration: 1 / 2000 [ 0%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 4: Iteration: 200 / 2000 [ 10%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 4: Iteration: 400 / 2000 [ 20%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 4: Iteration: 600 / 2000 [ 30%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 4: Iteration: 800 / 2000 [ 40%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 4: Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%] (Warmup)\r## Chain 4: Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 4: Iteration: 1200 / 2000 [ 60%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 4: Iteration: 1400 / 2000 [ 70%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 4: Iteration: 1600 / 2000 [ 80%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 4: Iteration: 1800 / 2000 [ 90%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 4: Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%] (Sampling)\r## Chain 4: Elapsed Time: 1.848 seconds (Warm-up)\r## Chain 4: 1.683 seconds (Sampling)\r## Chain 4: 3.531 seconds (Total)\rSo in the model above, we’ve specified that we’re regressing Allowed on D.z using the priors in m1priors. You’ll also notice that we had to specify a likelihood, which is set by the family argument. As we had a dichotomous outcome, we set this to \u0026quot;bernoulli\u0026quot;. Finally, we used a seed to make the results the same each time we run this particular model.\nOk, now it’s time to look at the results. First, let’s just look at the summary of out model:\nsummary(m1)\r## Family: bernoulli ## Links: mu = logit ## Formula: Allowed ~ D.z ## Data: lrsmall (Number of observations: 2924) ## Samples: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\r## total post-warmup samples = 4000\r## ## Population-Level Effects: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Eff.Sample Rhat\r## Intercept 2.96 0.10 2.77 3.17 1346 1.00\r## D.z -1.07 0.09 -1.26 -0.89 1271 1.00\r## ## Samples were drawn using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Eff.Sample ## is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential ## scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).\rFirst of all, this summary provides some really useful information about the model, including the number of observations, chains, and iterations. For a more thorough description of this information, see the brms manual here.\nIf you’re just getting started with Bayesian data analysis, the most familiar information is going to be under the heading Population-Level Effects. Here you’ll find summary information about the regression slope and intercept. First of all, the Rhat values near 1.0 indicates that we have convergence. If Rhat values get too large (see here for a suggestion of 1.2 or 1.1) then we should be worried. Second, we see that the most credible values of the slope are negative, which is good because above we observed that D.z was negatively correlated with Allowed.\nSo while our logistic regression model indicates that there is a negative relationship between Allowed and D.z, the summary of the model has estimates on the log-odds scale, which can be difficult to interpret. So let’s use the tidybayes package (Kay, 2018) to put our results on the odds scale:\nparameters \u0026lt;- m1 %\u0026gt;% gather_draws(b_D.z) %\u0026gt;% median_hdi()\rprint(exp(parameters[c(\u0026quot;.value\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;.lower\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;.upper\u0026quot;)])) # exp() converts log-odds to odds\r## # A tibble: 1 x 3\r## .value .lower .upper\r## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 0.343 0.287 0.412\rOn the odds scale, we are comparing our estimate to 1.0. If the most credible value of the slope is mostly below 1.0, then we infer that there’s a negative association between Allowed and D.z. This is the case here as we are 95% sure (given the data and the model) that the slope is roughly between .28 and .40.\nFinally, let’s make a basic plot that shows the model predictions. Conveniently, brms has a command that makes this quite easy:\nplot(marginal_effects(m1), points = TRUE, rug = TRUE)\rThis plot shows the predicted probability of supporting adoption for same-sex couples at different levels of D.z. First, notice that for values below zero on the x-axis (i.e., below the mean IAT score) the support of this policy is quite high: near 1.0. Then, notice that the probability of supporting adoption right for same-sex couples drops, eventually bottoming out at about .50 for those respondents that have the strongest preference for straight people over gay people. Finally, while these are less useful when dealing with a large sample like we’re using here, the points and rug arguments plot the data data alongside the model predictions. You can see from the black dots show responses on the Allowed variable (either 0 or 1), while the black vertical lines at the bottom of the plot show scores on the D.z variable. These additional features are helpful for making sure that the model is providing a sensible fit to the data.\nOk, so that’s a basic logistic regression model using brms. Future posts might address some of the issues that we didn’t touch on here, such as what to do about missing data? How to create publication-worthy logistic regression plots? And what additional model assessments can we do with brms?\n\r","date":1547424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547424000,"objectID":"0e38e329656590acbb7dd89238653b29","permalink":"/post/bayesian-logistic-regression-using-brms-part-1/","publishdate":"2019-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bayesian-logistic-regression-using-brms-part-1/","section":"post","summary":"This is the first of a series of posts on how to fit, interpret, and evaluate Bayesian logistic regression models using the brms package in R.

Drawing on the threat and contact hypotheses, this study develops and tests a framework examining the role of segregation in the out-group size/prejudice relationship. We suggest that whether increasing minority share in a community generates processes of contact and/or perceived threat will depend on how segregated groups are from one another. This, in turn, will determine when high minority share communities have positive, negative, or null effects on inter-group attitudes. Using data from white British individuals in England, we observe that community segregation moderates the effect of community percent non-white British on prejudice, as well as mechanisms of positive inter-group contact and perceived threat. Residents of more homogeneous communities report relatively warm inter-group attitudes, regardless of how segregated they are. Residents living among high proportions of out-group where the groups are integrated report an improvement in out-group attitudes. It is only residents living among large out-group populations where groups are more segregated from one another-at the nexus of high minority share and high segregation-who report colder out-group attitudes. This higher prejudice is driven by both lower positive contact and higher perceived threat in these communities. Using two waves of cohort panel data, longitudinal analysis provides more robust evidence in support of the diversity-segregation nexus framework: communities becoming more ethnically mixed and segregated see prejudice increase, while those becoming more mixed and integrated see stable, or somewhat improving, relations. Collectively, this paper shows that mechanisms of positive contact and threat appear conditional on both the size of out-groups in an area and how segregated groups are from one another, generating key differences in when and how increasing ethnic out-group size affects inter-group relations.","tags":["Social Psychology","Intergroup Contact","Diversity","Multilevel Modeling"],"title":"Prejudice, Contact, and Threat at the Diversity-Segregation Nexus: A Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Analysis of How Ethnic Out-Group Size and Segregation Interrelate for Inter-Group Relations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["AL Skinner","JR Rae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1529467200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529467200,"objectID":"eaab097926575b2c48aec5f23cc2d318","permalink":"/publication/2018-skinner-rae/","publishdate":"2018-06-20T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-skinner-rae/","section":"publication","summary":"Interracial couples are an understudied but increasingly common social group in the United States.

When test-retest reliability and predictive validity have been assessed, the results have been mixed, and because these studies have differed on many factors simultaneously (lag-time between testing administrations, domain, etc.), it is difficult to discern what factors may explain variability in existing test-retest reliability and predictive validity estimates. Across five studies (total N = 519; ages 6- to 11-years-old), we manipulated two factors that have varied in previous developmental research-lag-time and domain. An internal meta-analysis of these studies revealed that, across three different methods of analyzing the data, mean test-retest (rs of .48, .38, and .34) and predictive validity (rs of .46, .20, and .10) effect sizes were significantly greater than zero. While lag-time did not moderate the magnitude of test-retest coefficients, whether we observed domain differences in test-retest reliability and predictive validity estimates was contingent on other factors, such as how we scored the IAT or whether we included estimates from a unique sample (i.e., a sample containing gender typical and gender diverse children). Recommendations are made for developmental researchers that utilize the IAT in their research.","tags":["Implicit Association Test","Developmental Psychology","Reliability","Validity","Meta-analysis"],"title":"Test-Retest Reliability and Predictive Validity of the Implicit Association Test in Children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JR Rae","AG Greenwald"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512018000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512018000,"objectID":"242ac67bdbaded983067f29013c0d344","permalink":"/publication/2017-rae-greenwald/","publishdate":"2017-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-rae-greenwald/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Implicit Association Test","Social Psychology","Reliability"],"title":"Persons or Situations?

BA is theorized to lead to changes in depression through changes in activation. While distal support for activation as a mechanism has been obtained, more research is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn. Research on mechanism should consider the appropriate time-frame for examining changes in the theorized mechanism variable and whether the proposed mechanism is expected to exert causal influence in all BA cases. These issues were considered in the current study in which a post-hoc analysis was conducted to explore BA's mechanism using single-subject data obtained at each session during the course of treatment.","tags":["Clinical Psychology"],"title":"A Client-Level Session-by-Session Evaluation of Behavioral Activation's Mechanism of Action","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

The model integrates established behavioral principles with existing research on the reciprocal process of self-disclosure and responsiveness that occurs during development of intimate relationships to highlight a promising therapeutic process. In this process, self-disclosure (courage in FAP's model) is evoked by the therapist and then reinforced with therapeutic responsiveness (love in the FAP model) resulting in improved self-disclosure and more connectedness in the therapy and other relationships. Study 1 included a sample of 77 undergraduate participants who self-disclosed responses to a series of closeness generating questions to undergraduate research assistants trained in responsiveness. Findings indicated that social connection increased following this full procedure. Study 2 included a sample of 99 undergraduate participants and provided evidence that the responsiveness of the research assistant is key to promoting increased feelings of connectedness and also improves the depth of disclosure.","tags":["Clinical Psychology"],"title":"Reinforcement Matters: A preliminary, Laboratory-Based Component-Process Analysis of Functional Analytic Psychotherapy's Model of Social Connection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JR Rae","AK Newheiser","KR Olson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1435723200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435723200,"objectID":"102291da13dc61f5a2713aba87cab601","permalink":"/publication/2015-rae-newheiser-olson/","publishdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-rae-newheiser-olson/","section":"publication","summary":"The industrialized world is becoming more ethnically diverse. Research in several disciplines has suggested that exposure to racial out-groups may be associated with more positive and more negative intergroup attitudes. Given that U.S. states are often at the center of debate regarding diversity-related public policy, we examined how exposure to out-groups is associated with state-level implicit and explicit race bias among White and Black Americans. We found that larger proportions of Black residents across U.S. states were associated with stronger implicit and explicit in-group bias among both White and Black respondents. State-level bias was predicted by proportions of Black residents even when controlling for (a) state-level demographic control variables (e.g., median income), (b) proportions of non-Black minorities, and (c) historical membership in the Confederacy. Our results convey the importance of investigating why diversity may not always have the positive impact on intergroup relations that one might hope it to have.","tags":["Implicit Association Test","Social Psychology","Multilevel Modeling"],"title":"Exposure to Racial Out-Groups and Implicit Race Bias in the United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JR Rae","SD Lonborg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1434081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1434081600,"objectID":"f00fd876a6cbd3408ec0dc0c1cc3f854","permalink":"/publication/2015-rae-lonborg/","publishdate":"2015-06-12T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-rae-lonborg/","section":"publication","summary":"Previous investigations of the relationship between Facebook use and psychological well-being have most commonly considered variables relating to the quantity (e.g., time spent online) and underlying motivations (e.g., making new friends) of Facebook consumption. However, previous research has reached contradictory conclusions in that quantity of Facebook use has been linked to both higher and lower levels of psychological well-being. The current study investigated whether these contradictory findings of quantity of Facebook use could be explained by considering users' motivations for accessing Facebook. We predicted that quantity of use would be positively associated with psychological well-being when users primarily accessed Facebook to maintain existing relationships but negatively associated with psychological well-being when primarily accessed to create new relationships. In a sample of college undergraduates (N = 119), we found that the relationship of quantity of Facebook use on psychological well-being was moderated by the motivation of the user. Quantity of Facebook use was associated with higher levels of psychological well-being among users that accessed Facebook for friendship purposes but was negatively associated with psychological well-being among users that accessed Facebook for connection purposes (e.g., making new friends). We also replicated our results across dimensions of psychological well-being (e.g., anxiety and life satisfaction). The current findings provide initial evidence that quantity and motivations of Facebook use interact with potentially serious implications for psychological well-being and also provide a possible explanation for why quantity of Facebook use can be linked with both positive and negative psychological well-being.","tags":["Implicit Association Test","Social Psychology","Multilevel Modeling"],"title":"Do Motivations for using Facebook Moderate the Association between Facebook use and Psychological Well-Being?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["RJ Kohlenberg","M Tsai","AM Kuczynski","JR Rae","E Lagbas","J Lo","JW Kanter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1427860800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1427860800,"objectID":"e89dd95c0397d321466786ae00636a60","permalink":"/publication/2015-kohlenberg-etal/","publishdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-kohlenberg-etal/","section":"publication","summary":"A brief, group mindfulness intervention targeting both state mindfulness and social connectedness was developed based on Functional Analytic Psychotherapy??s model of awareness, courage, and love.

Results indicated significant benefits of all three conditions with respect to state mindfulness with both mindfulness conditions outperforming the nature video, and significant benefits of both mindfulness conditions with respect to social connectedness, with the interpersonal mindfulness condition outperforming the intrapersonal condition.
